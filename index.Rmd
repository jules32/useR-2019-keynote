NO UM START >> WELL

TODO LANG

Well thank you so much, I am so excited to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

I am a marine ecologist and R as a language and as a community has been game0changing for my science, and my life. 

So much so that over the past six years I have been moving away from doing my own research so I can pay forward what I've learned and focus on enabling other scientists to better science in less time, together. 

Throughout this I've learned several lessons, and I want to share them up front: 

---
class: inverse
# Lessons learned 
<br>

### Open data science is a mindset
### Teamwork starts with openness 
### Harness the power of welcome

???

The 3 lessons are Open data science is a mindset, Teamwork starts with openness, and Harness the power of welcome.  

I'm going to spend the whole talk building out these lessons.

But first I wanted to tell a bit about me and the main experiences that have driven these lessons. 

So let me start off when I was a graduate student in a marine research group, which we also call laboratories in the US.

So I am actually a squid ecologist, and my PhD research group focused on squid. These are photos from our field work at sea, studying a really incredible squid that can get nearly as big as I am. 

That is me on the right, releasing a squid back into the ocean with an electronic tag that turns it into a little oceanographer as it swam.

???

Our research required a lot of teamwork, both at sea and in the laboratory. 

In short, we were a typical research group that collaborated around the science. 

But we didn't act like a team when it came to data. Analyzing data was something that was left to each of us to figure out as individuals.  

In in all my education I had never learned computing or how to work responsibly with data. So for me —

???

For me, it meant feeling like this. 

This is Luke Skywalker after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Degobah. 

He cannot solve the the challenge in front of him with the skillsets he has. 

He is demoralized and alone. And if you imagine him attempting to use whatever pulleys and ropes he might have with him, you know it wouldn't be pretty, it wouldn't be reproducible, and it probably wouldn't get him where he needs to be on time. 

transition: but luckily what happens next is that he meets Yoda

knitr::include_graphics("img/horst-starwars-yoda.png") 
```

.footnote[

]

???

Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible. 

This is going to open up Luke's whole world because he can learn from Yoda and not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future. 

transition: But Luke didn't go on to defeat the Empire himself, he had a whole community.

R is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time. 

It empowers us to get our own data out of the swamp and build off of our confidence and experiences and broaden the scope of challenges that we can tackle. 

For me, I didn't fully feel this power until I finished graduate school and joined a research group where we learned to work with data as a team.

```{r OHI hex, out.width = '55%', fig.align='center'}

The Ocean Health Index is a scientific endeavor to quantify impacts and benefits of oceans around the world using the best publically available data. 

It is being used by the United Nations and by twenty groups around the world and there is a lot more to say about it. 

But what is relevant here is that we combine lots of data and repeat our work every year, and we do it as a team.

But when we went to repeat our work, we felt like Luke

and that is represented in this figure here by the circles getting smaller. 

And the axes represent how it got easier to easier to reproduce each year as well, and also it easier to collaborte with others, including our future selves, new teammembers that joined, or one of those twenty groups I mentioned. 

So you can see we made this incrementally improved how we worked over several years, and the initial impetus to do so was really tough. 

And in additional to making our science better every year, it has enabled 20 independent groups around the world to use our science and our code to study ocean health in the places they care about.

This is the vision I see for environmental science: where the elements that environmental scientsts are great it are streeamlined together by ODS. 

Looking at the left at environmental data:  We see data in the environment and systems we study. We are great at at theory, developing hypotheses, and experimental design.

And on the right, we are getting better and better at communication and helping our findings get to the right audiences, to inform dexisions around food systems, disease transmission, sustainability, and climate change. 

And this can be streamlined with ods because tools like R because R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

I know this graphic looks familiar from R4DS, but notice that all of the data science components here are ringed by communities and support. 

So this is the vision for science, amnd I am optimistic we can make this happen because I have made this transition myself, also because Openscapes participants are well on their way after only 5 months.

But right now it looks like this. We rarely have formal training and so folks learn in pockets and are unsupported at broader instituti8onal levels, but also at the level of the rsearch team.

Helping complete this picture drives my work now. 

I want to pay forward what I have learned. 

And it drives the lessons learned I shared in the beginning. 

I've found that scientists might now be aware of what tools are availabe. But that that is not really the problem. 

The problem is about mindset and feeling that open data science is somethign not only in their scientific futures, but in their scientific presents. 

So with Openscapes I work with scientists to welcome them to what this scientific present can look like for them, and I help them start paths to making it happen. Because OHI is one of the most visible examples of what this can look like, I rely heavily on it as motivition and examples, and I'll do that for the rest of the talk as well.

# Open data science is a mindset

### expect a better way • build confidence & willingness • reimagine science communication

???

Open data science is a mindset involves data science and open science and is creative and collaborative and fueled by what is possible with the internet. 
It's how the Force was not only a skillset but it broadened Luke's mind of what was possible and the scope of challenges he could tackle. 

And to help get into that mindset it's important to understand current mindsets and how to help reframe them.

# Expect there is a better way

???
TODO lang MAYBE DROP THE DATES AND FOCUS ON EXCLUDE
Expecting there is a better way to work with your data can be at odds with the mindset you have in science. 

Because as scientists, we are asking questions that no one knows the answer to. 

In my squid research, no one knew where these squid behaved in California, my data contained secrets on the forefront of discovery. So when I needed to reformat dates into ISO-15(?), this was a task completely interwoven with my squid. I did not expect that this was not something I had to do from scratch. 

Part of why I couldn't expect there was a better way is because I didn't have any idea of what was possible, and I also didn't have the vocabulary to articulate our struggles and ask for help.

This definition resonates with me because I can see myself included in it. 

transition: And to be able to acgtually see data analysis as a graphic that has as discrete steps —

<!---
We talk about data science with this definition: that data science is the discipline of turning raw data into understanding. 

This is a definintion that resonates with environmental scientists, because we can see this as being useful in our own work. 

And this is important, because if you just read about data science in the news, you can come away with a pretty narrow defintion that it means big data, AI, and machine learning. 

And that immediately excludes many scientists who could benefit so much from what I feel data science is, a discipline concepts, theory, and tools to work with data.

that clearly describe what I have been fumbling around trying to do from scratch was so powerful. It took this burden off my shoulders and provided a framework to get to my science sooner.  

clear steps of things that every scientist does but few have articulated. 

This figure has been incredibly impactful on my life. One of my biggest challenges as a scientist was that I could not distinguish what were data challenges away from what were science challenges. PRACTICE BOTH WAYS

<The idea of tidying your data first and then being streamlined with the tools you can use for science is amazing. Rather than accommodating around weird data.

transition TODO So expecting there is a better way is a big part of this. And that is part of the mindset. 

Seeing data science as something that can be a part of your scientific present, is a huge shift in mindset. and along with it comes

class: middle, center
# Build confidence & willingness

???

The next is build confidence & willingness to engage in a different way to work. 

And open science is a big part of this. 

Open science has many different definitions and even more interpretations. 

For many environmental scientists, including me as a graduate student, open science is not a positive thing. 

It means people stealing my data or misstruling my science. There are softer interpretations, where it means posting data and code publically at the end of a research study when the final manuscript is published. 

In interpreations like these, there is no benefit to the individual practicing open science. There is only cost in terms of time and risk.

So it's a lot easier to just avoid it.

Open science as a way to be more efficient and streamlined
Not an added ask at publication to share your data

I like this definition of open science

I teach that open science is a spectrum, with many entryways and paths to iteratively 

I like this too because it helps dispell the idea that you're either doing open science or you're not, and the activiation energy required to make that switch impossible task. 

Instead, what we talk about in Openscapes is how there are many entryways, and many ways to anticipate. 

Sharing a pdf of your presentation. Or using google slides. That is part of open science.

# Reimagine science communication

Scicomm is something we really value. 
We are very similar to the open source community like R and Moz in that all of our work is for the public good. 

So comm is very imp

For a lot of people, science communication still largely occurs at the end of a study, when everything is complete. 

And I think this mindset is rooted in the fact that for a long time, sharing your work was hard to do. 

But the internet provides amazing channels to share our work not only at the end, but throughout all of the process. This is critical to establish trust and buy-in for the results and calls to action we uncover about our environment.

And let me say up front that I can be a big curmudgen about introducing extra software into my life and having to create new user accounts. I remember in one NSSD episode, Roger Peng said that if he has to create a new user account, he's like 50% out. For me it's like 80. 

And why I mention that is that we can do so much of this reimagined science communication with the tools we are already using for analyses:

Teams to me means rings of people you respect, collaborate with, and can rely upon. It does not have to be limited to a certain deliverable, location, discipline or anything else. 

Teamwork is critical in science because no one it can do it all. and for the sake for innovation as well as for emotional well-being. And that is because no one can do it all, and we need to shed the expectation that we should. 

There are some blurred lines here but one of the cooles things to me is how teamwork and collaboration and leadership and community all intertwine when you work openly.

And here they are, all together and with their lab members, who are graduate students, postdocs, technicians, lab managers, visiting faculty. 

We all meet twice each month to discuss open data science concepts and to build community as we try weaving these practices into our every day work. 

Lab members are responsible for planning out more hands-on work <TODO>

# Working openly

???

Critical to learn something new together. 

We work really openly with each other. We co-develop things, we share early drafts, and we are constantly giving feedback and iterating with each other. 

What is it? it's about feeling the tension and finding the balance

These can be hard. On on individual level, it can take some soul searching. But critical for a team. There is mindset involved here too.

trust & assuming best intentions

respecting each other's time.

innovation & learn from failure

it's about resilience and avoiding burnout

transition: one of the ways to start working on this as a team is to create safe spaces where you can deliberately talk about shared stuff.

# Lab culture
<br>
### Code of Conduct
### Onboarding
### Seaside Chats 
### Lab Hackathons


???

Thnk about this in terms of individuals and tone they set as a team

deliberate

It's about thinking what Future You might need but also what Future Us might need. 

coopted the idea of hackathons, where we will all drop our own projects and come together for a day or an afternoon to do something that will benefit the whole group. but is no one's responsibility directly

So this is where we will actually overhaul our filepath conventions or refactor and modernize all our code with dplyr instead of plyr. 

In both seaside chats and hackathons we've also developed written protocols for onboarding new teammembers so that they can get upskilled and in our workflow as soon as possible.

With Openscapes, we've discussed doing hackathons to put data in one place and write data dictionaries and metadata.

So a few examples of what Champions have done here: 

- Wood lab seaside chats

- Pinsky lab CoC and cookbook

- Nina pathway


transition: one final thing that we do as an OHI team, and that is critical, is that we prioritize social time


transition: So this is all critical to operating like a team and being able to engage effectively and collaboratlively with ODS

And this team culture was ignited and nurtured by really supportive leadership.

TODO Lang see below



This is Ben Halpern, he's the lead of OHI and also the director of NCEAS, the ecology center where we are based. 

He set this tone for our team, and has played a huge role in our data science even though he is not a coder himself. 

And this is really critical. 

As a leader he listened to our excitement and he supported us to invest time and resources in open data science, and he trusted us to implement shared practices for our team.

He's making environmental data science a priority at NCEAS, and has also spearheaded a new masters program in environmental science at the University of California 

transition: so with Openscapes, I also mentor the research group leads individually so that they can become champions for open data science and have an oversized influence like Ben has had. 

////



We all had agency and support to become leaders within our lab group, and beyond. 

This is Ben Best, Jamie Afflerbach and me. They are my teammates but they have also been  leaders for me. Ben spent countless hours sitting with me and teaching me R and was patient when I deliberately made emails from github go to my spam folder because I thought GitHub was not going to be useful to me. 

And Jamie is an amazing leader as well, I'll tell a story about her in a moment. 

And together we are partners in crime. We cofounded EDS with other friends and have taught multiple carpentries workshops together. This is us preparing for the Shiny conference in 2016. 

transition: Enabling this kind of leadership within teams is what I try to ignite with Openscapes.

And Michelle Stuart is an excellent example. She is actually here at useR, where is she?
 
She is in the Pinsky lab and spearheads their seaside chats. She made a GitHub account during one of our Openscapes calls and then helped others in the lab do so as well. 

So she has become not only become a leader within the Pinsky Lab, she has become a lead in the broader community.

# Community

???

Open data science communities are online and in person, and they break down boundaries between traditional disciplines.

I used to have my feet squarely in the marine science community, but now I feel like a bridge across environemtnal science, R community and the Mozilla communities. 

I've learn so much from each and try to help channel those lessons between groups.

My teammate Jamie encouraged to join twitter to learn R. 

I was definitely skeptical. I did not use Twitter because I thought it was a megaphone for angry people. 

But she taught me how to use it to to listen and learn from other others. And then to gradually build up the courage to like and retweet things. 

And that this was not only a way to become part of the community yourself, but it was a way to welcome and amplify other people who might be unsure of what they were doing too.  

So I was amazed that you could have community on Twitter

And I was also amazed that developers were real people. And not only that, they were super nice people that made me feel welcome and valued even as I was doing, there, or in life more generally

Prior to these conversations, I had never stopped to think that there were real people behind software. 

transition: And I don't think that's entirely my fault, because before twitter, this is the closest I'd ever come:

But realizing that software developers went well beyond Clippy here was really a defining point in my life. 

This is was that turning point when I really became the person I am today — that person who never stops talking about how awesome R is and how it will change your life

So, rOpenSci and RStudio. I'm deliberately limiting myself by putting them on the same slide here because I could talk about both of them. 

They have been so supportive and welcoming fromt the get go. And it was so exctiging to be able to particitae in unconfs and dev conferences

They have created communities where developers and new users who are strangers become collabortors and friends and where there is deliberate attention to setting the right space to make that happen. 

It was a big deal to not only connect online, but also in person, with so many other people in these communiies. It really solidified that we were part of this. And I wanted Openscapes to have this same opportunity

So midway through the Openscapes program, we were able to get the research leads together in person in California. 

Not only this give them an opportunity to meet each other as scientists who are engaging in open data science, but we tried replicate what I have experienced at rOpenSci and RStudio conferences and we included Sean from the R community and Christie Bahlai from the Mozilla community. 

So I had high expections about how awesome this would be but they were exceeeded. 

Up to this point they understood that all of this was powerful and they knew I was really excited about it, but they left the summit actually feeling it for themselves.

RLadies is changing the world, starting off by increasing gender diverstity in the R community. 

And so when we talk about this in Openscapes, it's not only to encourage scientists to become a part of RLadies, but to kicks-start this kind of movement in science. 

RLadies as a global program and as so many individual has given given me confidence in myself, and made me be a better advocate for women in science. 

And along with Michelle you I already told you about we are seeing this now with the Openscapes scientists too:

data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop that streamlines how we work and innovate. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

You really need both. Trying to engage solely with open data science without teamwork can be lonely and deflating. And only as a team but without the best collaborative software can be inefficient.

in a time when env sci is our most pressing probs are related to env it's critical that those scientits have the tools and team to answer those quiestions using data.

One of final slides
"this is powerful for science" >>> it's part of this for science. but it's also powerful for people. mental health, leaky pipeline, burnout. and maybe include this too. This is really powerful for science and individuals and teams.
