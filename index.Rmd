KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big
When I say science = = "bring #rstats to science" what does that mean
"when I say bring to science the level I'm talking about is here" 


TOO MANY WORDS> the most important things get lost if each is a full paragraph

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs


instead of saying "i've been thinking a lot about" "the question I ask: how can we bring this ethos to env sci". That's been guiding my efforts

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

R has changed my life, and so much that now I'm actively working to have it to change the lives of more scientists like me.

Next time: stand up and present!
SUMMARIZE AS A HEADER
people love feeling they're smart and they love feeling they're making progress (so get off the title slides)

Q's for Allison: 

- aaaaaah I love the R4DS drawing!!!
- first slides, I need to pick, what should it be: 
  - R and data science
  - data science and open practices
  - open data science
  - open/data science (read as 'open data science')
  
  Data science and teamwork?
  <<Data science and teamwork>> AMAZINGGGGGGG
  that's a bummer feedback loop. bidirectional, loop
  
- add Star Wars at the beginning? 
- and Luke in the center of the R4DS?

- repeat story arc: trouble, r can help! repeat (2 more times if do star wars). Maybe I take out the sad face and the "to be clear". 

- Also: can you send me an invoice. 2K

this is my work, I'm neck-deep if I am asking the question if this is ncessarry? The answer is no every time.

## R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research.

???

NO UM START What's my starting word? WELL or SO

Well thank you so much, it is so amazing to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

Data science and teamwork have incredible potential accelerate scientific research. They can help uncover solutions to our most pressing problems, which in the environmental space where I work include food security and sustainable resource use on land and in the oceans.

---
## R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research.

## But many environmental scientists are being excluded from this potential.  

???

But many environmental scientists are being excluded from this potential. 

---
## R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research.

## But many environmental scientists are being excluded from this potential.  

## We lack opportunities to learn and we lack a supportive scientific culture.

???

We lack opportunities to learn data science and we lack a scientific culture that supports us to incorporate it into our research. 

It is not even a part of our culture to talk about data practices, which makes teamwork and collaboration more difficult since we do not have the mindset or really even the vocabulary to do so.

transition:: But I know that we can change this culture in environmental science, and in other scientific fields as well.
---
# But R can help

???

And we can do it following the example of this R community here. 

And the R community has really focused on creating a positive space for people like me to be welcomed as human beings, and encouraged and supported as coders. 

This makes the R community such a powerful team for innovation and collaboration, and I think this is exactly what environmental science needs.

---
# Changes in mindset and culture

???

Creating a true cultural change in environmental science will require mindest shifts in individuals — 

And I know this is possible because I have lived through this mindset change myself, and I have spent the last 6 years igniting cultural change in environmental science by working with colleagues around the world. 

It can be really intimidating to engage in data science and learn to code, especially when we also do not see examples of its benefits in our own context, and we are not aware of welcoming entry points to engage. 

We are scientists that are passionate about our work, and well-trained in our scientific domains. But we pretty immediately realize that we don't have the tools or skillsets to work responsibly with my data. 

Most of us do end up coding to some degree. But it is something we resist as long as we can before learning just enough to get the job done at the last moment, usually in a total panic. 

I actually like talking about this with analogies from Star Wars.

---
# Luke 

???

This is Luke after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Degobah. 

He is there staring at a challenge that he cannot solve with the skillsets he has. 

It is super demoralizing, and he has no idea how to even begin this process. 

Imagine for a moment if he had tried to rig up some pullees and levers. 

It would not have been pretty. Or reproducible. It wouldn't be something he was proud of and he wouldn't have wanted anyone to know about. And, he wouldn't have learned much to prepare for any upcoming challenges.

transition: but what happens next is that he meets Yoda 

---
# Yoda

???

And Yoda has a skillset to solve  Luke's problem in a way he never imagined: he uses the Force. 

And Luke can learn from Yoda, and he will develop skills to not only solve this problem, but it will open his mind to what is possible and the challenges he can take on. 

transition: But the Force alone didn't make Luke successful, it is the community that he is a part of. 

---
# Hands

???

Luke works with a team that is not only Jedis that have the same skillsets he does. This community/movement made up of diverse people that have different backgrounds and expertise, and all of them contribute in really important ways. 

So the Force is R or what I talk about as open data science, which includes open practices and teamwork. And the community is us, the people in this room. 

transition: And we can help welcome more environmental scientists into this community because this is what environmental science should feel like.

Having this R community has been so impactful for me as a scientist. Instead of feeling stranded in a swamp like I have several times in my scientific career, I feel more powerful than I ever imagined. 

You here in this room have helped me change the way I do science and the way I think about what is possible. You have empowered me and helped me build confidence that translates well beyond code. 

transition: So we'll come back to star Wars, but now let's come back to this planet and talk about what it's like to be an environmental scientist.

---
# Horst environment

???

Environmental scientists have a lot in common with the open source community because we are working for the public good, and passionate about our work. 

Environmental science is actually not a distinct discipline, but a collective term used to describe science interface of ecology and people/society.

We are deeply interdisciplinary, because our research questions require us to become experts in the many different domains we work in. 

For example, a ecologist studying how pollinators affect agriculture crops might also need to understand the biology, behavior, and genomics of different bee populations, as well as local and regional patterns of water availabity through rain, snowmelt, and drought. 

transition: And our resulting findings are really impactful for society.

---
# Horst environment & comms

???

Our findings help understand food systems, disease transmission, and climate change. And this means that communicating and collaborating with many different people is critical. We are often working with government bodies at local and international scales to help inform change on the ground.


As you can see, environmental scientists are doing critical work addressing problems, but there is this gap here in their skillsets that can cause delays when we have no time to waste.

<!---
So we work in different domains but something that unifies us is that we collect and work with a lot of data. 

transition: But since we often rig up our analyses the way Luke would have, and this means we're not really proud of our code, which means we are less inclined to talk about it, and resistant to sharing it. And this perpetuates the culture of not talking about data and coding, and therefore not valuing it. 

--->

---
# Horst complete

???

But that's why I think data science and teamwork can really complete this picture here. 

R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

So with I want to do is not only welcome more environmental scientists to the R community, I want to simultaneously extend our values and our ethos to environmental science so that scientists can work more streamlined as a team.

transition: So over the past year with my Mozilla Fellowship, I've been trying to do this through a program I've developed called Openscapes.

---
# (outline slide)
.pull-right[Openscapes hex

- mentorship program for research groups

- just completed pilot cohort!
]

???

With Openscapes I'm focusing on building this culture at the core community unit of science, the research group or laboratory. 

Openscapes is a mentorship program for research groups, helping them engage with open data science and become visible examples and vocal champions for open data science within their broader communities. 

We've just completed the pilot cohort of this mentoring program with 7 research groups, and I'm excited to tell you all about it bc I am so proud of what they accomplished.

.pull-left[OHI hex

- example of data science & teamwork
- R is game-changing for communication & culture
]

???

But to tell the Openscapes story I need to first tell the Ocean Health Index story. 

And that's because I designed Openscapes based on what we experienced with the Ocean Health Index, because it is an example of how powerful data science and teamwork can be for environmental science. 

R not only made it easier do analyses better, but also has been game-changing for communication and culture. 

Being able to efficiently share and communicate our work while it is ongoing rather than only post-publication has been really critical for us bridging science and policy. 

It really has been like the Force, broadening our minds to what is possible for science. 

transition: so let's talk about the Ocean Health Index

---
# OHI hex, bigger centered


---
# OHI measure illustration
Halpern 2012

???

The Ocean Health Index is a project to measure what we value about our oceans using the best available data and science. 

One of the big things we do is we score how healthy oceans are for every coastal country around the world using nearly 100 publically available data sets, and we repeat this every year to track change through time. 

It is a really ambitious project. 

We set out to be the best approach for data-driven marine policy around the world, and indeed now it is used by the United Nations and also by twenty government and university groups. 

transition: We did NOT set out to be the best approach for what open data science could look like in environmental science —

---
# Nature E&E paper (authors only no abstract)

???

But when we realized that the way we worked enabled us to do better science in less time, we shared this story in a publication in 2017.

This publication is a retrospective of how we incrementally improved our workflow since that first publication 5 years earlier. 

It tells and how R & and GitHub helped change the culture of our science, because it made our work faster and better, and also turned our science open source so that others could use and build from it. 

But it also talks about how hard this transition was for us. 

transition: We had to completely change the way we had always worked and seen other people work.

# Data Analysis_v2.xls
Data Analysis Explanation.doc
data_12_11_12.R

re:fwd:final data updated
Final Report.pdf

circa 2012

???

This is how we had been working to do this study with 100 data sets. We truly thought that this would be reproducible, and knew that we ourselves would be redoing this whole effort the next year, the second of many times. 

So it was also really deflating and embarassing that it was not. And we had deadlines and pressures to keep, and it just seemed really unattainable, like getting that plane out of the swamp.  

transition: but let me tell you up front how we did it

---
# 1. We were a team
2. someone jazzed about R
3. team lead valued & supported us

???
There are a couple of key things about this transition for us. 
1. we thought of ourselves as a team. This seems simple but it was a big deal. We trusted each other and were willing to learn from each other, and teach each other. We were willing to talk about the tools we were using and move towards all working with a common set of tools. 
1. we had someone on our team that was really jazzed about R and willing to patiently teach us
1. we had a team lead who saw value in us investing time and resources

So this gave us time and space to learn R and GitHub together as a team.

ALl of us had GH accounts, even BH

We came up with systems for organizing and naming files, and learning R from each other.

So for this first year we were focused on easing into these tools. Still really in kind of repair/damage control mode, trying to using R in a pretty narrow sense, strictly for data analysis. 

Our collegue Ben, the one who was jazzed about R, was using Shiny and devtools and had a vision of where this could take us but I personally was still pretty narrowminded about R, partly due to my own skillset that narrowed my mindset. 

---
# rOpenSci, Twitter

???

But then 2 important things happened: we met Karthik adn rOpenSci, and we joined Twitter. 

At the rOpenSci conf, we met Joe and Hadley and other folks and I was really blown away that developers were real people, and real people that were super nice and that we could talk with. My experience with software before that had not really had a person behind it — 

transition: unless you can count Clippy. 

---
# Clippy, question mark

???

---
# pic of us with Hadley & Joe

???

so it was a big deal to be feel so welcomed here, and it really broadened my thinking of of what community is and what teamwork is. 

I really felt that this was more than code, it was a better way to work and a better way to do science. 

transition: this is when I really the defining point where I became that person that would not stop talking about how life-changing R and open science and the R community is 

transition: so much so that even my 3 year old niece knew about dplyr and ggplot.

```

---
# ohicore package (screenshots)
R projects & GitHub repos

???

So we felt really empowered. And all of this was reflected in our work. 

For our analyses we were working with a common set of tools, set up standard operating procedures. We started doing spatial analysis in R,

This helped us think in the same way together. 

transition: and this is when R really changed the game for communication. 

---
# ohi-science.org

???

This is the website for our project that we made with Jekyll, and it now seems crazy that we didn't always have it. It started off as a simple one pager, where we could put pdfs for partners to download. Now it has so much more, it's a central hub for anyone wanting to learn more information about how we do those OHI for all countries globally — 

transition: and also it's a place where folks can learn how to do their own. 

---
# OHI+ map? (maybe just points)? (CI logo?)

???

I mentioned that over 20 groups are using the OHI to assess ocean health in their own waters around the world. This has been We were able to help them learn how to do this with resources on the website, but also by creating GitHub repos for them that contained all of our code and data as a starting point for them. 

GitHub lets us distribute and share with collaborators in a way that was never possible before, and I teach and help troubleshoot through github. It's been so streamlined. 

transition: part of this also involved generating simple RMarkdown websites for them so that they can communicate about their work with their own stakeholders. 

---
# OHI Cornwall
ohirepos::deploy_website(repo_registry, push = TRUE) 

???

These simple RMarkdown websites have been SO valuable for us. They have turned us into web developers. We can auto-generate them for any country, we probably have 30 of them that we've made, including for the global assessments that are used by the UN. 

---
# ohi-global website 

???

transition: RMarkdown has really changed the game for us for communicating with our partners and groups. These simple websites help us organize and present data, but also —

---
# ohi-northeast dashboard

???
We are also using shiny in a few ways, but I think this is one of the coolest. 

We are leading OHI Northeast, and it is actually included in part of President Obama's ocean plan. 

The code is based from XXX's, who we saw present at RStudio::conf 2018. 

---
# toolbox-training

???

Bookdown is such an amazing thing! It's turned us into authors. This book is still in the works, but it is to help people us our OHI package and workflow

---
# data-science-training
(animate with screenshots from SWC events?)

???

And this is one we wrote to teach people our workflow so that they can work with #rstats and Github like we do.

We teach this through SWC

started leading our own communities too

<!---
# Issues

# Box 1 & 2 excerpts

???

And in the paper we also share resources for what helped us learn. This includes R4DS and Stat 545, but also NSSD 

Also, recommendataions for how to get started. 

This has also helped with onboarding new team members onto our team.

---
# Team
Pics: HH with fellows, BB-Jamie-me laughing, pier with Erich & Eva
(does this fit here? not sure)

???
So here we are; 

We've come a long way. 

Now, we are still repeating that assessment each year, but to do so we actually started a fellowship program for graduate student interns: we train them in data science and how our team works and they lead the assessment. 

---
# Nature paper reprise

???

Additionally, this publication has been pretty well received. 

So sharing our story is helping increase the visibility of how open data science can be game-changing.  

Like I said, OHI is used by 20 groups around the world, and will be included in the UN's ocean indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals. 

And it has also been influential in the environmental science community more broadly. 

But it does not fully hit the mark for inspiring people to engage. I've gotten feedback that it still feels unachievable to people and excludes people who don't feel like they were part of a team. 

---
# data science <-> teamwork doodle


???

A main takeaway that I've learned through OHI is that data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop. 

Learning similar software promotes teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn data science. 

This is a loop that feeds back on itself (porridge?) <!---So for a lot of us in this room, this turns into a feedback loop and get almost difficult to differentiate and tease apart. so it might be less of a loop but more like a porridge...--->

But what if you are currently standing outside of this loop? 

transition: What are the entryways to get into it?

---
# Openscapes hex, center

???

And that's really the motivation behind Openscapes.

If this cool feedback loop that we've found successful doesn't exist, how do you create it? (Boooooo For example, if a group operates as a team, how do you introduce them to data science? Or if someone uses data science, how do you help them create a team?)

And if someone is outside of it, how do you welcome them?

And additionally:

How do you help people become confident championing this in their communities, even if they are not experts?

Increase the visibility of open practices? 

<!---Openscapes is a program to welcome environmental scientists to become champions for ODS. --->

---
# Labs

??? 
I've focused on working with community groups that already exist in science: the research group or what we would call laboratories in the US

Labs do not have culture of talking about data, and don't think of themselves as a team. They are often outside of this loop. 

One of the first things I learned as I was developing openscapes is that these laboratories do not always have the mindset that they are a team. In science we've focused on what makes us distinct, not what unites us. 


---
# Allison welcome to #rstats illustration

So with Openscapes, I'm really trying to figure out how to engage and welcome scientists in. And returning to the idea of visibility, 

focusing on early career faculty, lecturers, program managers. 
with early career faculty and lecturers. The reason I focus on early career lab groups is bc this is my generation of scientist, which means they have struggled with data as individuals and and it's s perfect opportunity to intervene and set a deliberate, r-inspired culture in their lab . 

particularly focused on ECRs. *[I do that because Without formal academic training, self-taught early career researchers are especially being left behind – and now in leadership positions as faculty, lecturers, and program managers, they are passing homegrown approaches to their labs. There is great opportunity to empower early career scientific leaders with our existing open science tools and communities so their labs can help uncover data-driven solutions faster.]*

<!---[place here for Star Wars?] Put this for Openscapes> THIS IS MINE. When I'm talking about this, this is how I describe it, give a nod to having used it before.--->

# engage, empower, amplify

I've focused on engage, empower, amplify

goal is to complement existing efforts and help welcome more scientists to them. 

-5 months, i've also started doing them as workshops

# Engage

I also like to talk about this with star wars analogies

# Empower
???
lesson series: 2 halves
For the most part, *not* teaching hands on. More of a "meet and greet", 
intro to communities like rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, RStudio. 
intro to tools like GitHub issues, markdown. This is the only thing we do hands on: to smooth communicationand culture
identifying packages like the tidyverse, rOpenSci, etc. Not teaching them, meet and greet.

---
# Amplify
(tweet screenshots for these)

Don't just say I get to amplify them. I'm teaching them what amplification means for good mentors

We need to amplify people in our lab. Adrian is going to comment about Sam. 

???
And then I get to amplify them. I am so proud of their accomplishments. So I'm going to take a few minutes to brag about their awesome science.

Really focused on not only change inside the lab but outside.

This is Malin Pinsky and his lab

# Struggles this is limitations, a bummer. 

Moving forward, this is what we need to happen to make env scientists able to get the training they need. 

Current limitation, how to fix it. 
Have question marks in a table! I don't know how to fix this

- don't have time or support. I really see Openscapes treating the symptom not the problem: we need this taught more. Allison Horst has one of the few positions that I know, and it was on her own initiative that she turned this course from a largely theoretical stats course for environmental scientists to a hands-on data science course where she now teaches the tidyverse and GitHub.

- we've tested this in this pilot cohort, how to do in other struggles. 

---

# 2 hex stickers

???
(revisit if this makes sense)

So that is my work to this point, I'm fundraising to be able to lead Openscapes full-time, and am co-leading our OHI internship program. 

But I wanted to end with what we can all do to become leaders in our communities.


How do we motivate others?

Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you 

- a data scientist

but also 

- an author
- a web designer
- a designer
- a community member
- a leader


???
Say this to your colleagues: R makes me xyz

---
# Value

comes back to the value. 
lasting change in these labs, and will build out from there. 

I think Openscapes is a big part of the path forward and to not only welcoming more people to Rstats, but also extending rstats culture to other communities. And while I'm focused within my domain of environmental science, everything I've developed is discipline agnostic, ready to be used for other groups too. But this kind of community work is real work, and we need this valued and supported more too. 


BRING IT BACK TO R FOR SCIENCE COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE

---
# Thank you for this inclusive culture

(screenshot <https://twitter.com/nceas/status/1137388818989047814>?)

???
I want to end by saying thank you to this community for so many things, but particurly to its leadership in creating a diverse and inclusive space. I have learned so much about the importance of diverse and inclusive spaces, and this is an area that I in particular want to help extend these aspects of our culture to the environmental science community, and well beyond. 

Thank you.

Selection requirements: 

early career scientific leads (col 1)
- faculty
- lecturers
- program managers
- etc

- rising star, influential scientists that can also become ambassadors for ODS
- not yet engaged in open data science
- trust that I will not waste their time

I decided to focus on early career scientific leaders for a few reasons
But I was also having a lot of one-on-one conversations with colleagues of mine, friends from grad school who were now running their own labs. 

Early career PIs might not yet know about the Force. They may have struggled through like Luke in their PhDs, worked their butts off to secure faculty jobs, and are now leading their own teams. How about focusing on them?


---

Explicit statement:::::::
there's this aspect of open tools and the aspect of community. and we want this to be both. transition in the analogy: but once luke learned to use the force, he didn't go out adn defeat the empire on his his own. he needed his community. 

We need to focus on the tools and also on the community.

# /#rstats
Hands w/ logos: RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla


???

Our #rstats community is so amazing. 

It is welcoming, it is inclusive, it is supportive, it is empowering. 

There is such a mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, from all over the world, online and in person, innovating and learning together. 

What's different about our community is that we put people first and are really here to share ideas and learn together. 

We are all here because we have been empowered by R as a tool and a community, but we can all probably think of others that are still feeling stranded and alone. We might work with them day-to-day.

# Figure 1, but just axes and whole bubbles

This illustration conveys how repeating our work each year takes less time, and got easier on the collaboration and reproducibility fronts. 

---
# Fig 1, now with text 

This has freed up our time to work on improving documentation and training, along with improving the science as better data and methods were available. 

I joined the team in 2013, the first year we were going to recalculate scores with an additional year of data. And this 2013 circle is not as small as you would imagine it would be if repeating our work from the previous year involved hitting go on a bunch of scripts. 

transition: And that's because in 2013 we were working the way we always had as marine ecologists — and we thought we were being reproducible.

# data_analysis_v2.xls
data_12_11_12.R
re:fwd:final data updated

???

Our story starts off here, in 2013. 

I know this looks painful but we had been doing data processing in whatever way we had all learned on our own previously. Most was in excel and a bit in R, with decisions documented in accompanying Word documents and emails. 

So then the year I started when we went to repeat the analysis, there was a lot of forensics and detective work to uncover what we had even done the first time, much less figuring out how to repeat it. 

*[What strikes me about this now is that these ways we had all been working had gotten us far, our team had PhDs and masters degrees and are now working at a really prestigious center. So these homegrown ways got us far for a little while as individuals, but they did not work as a team. ]*

Needless to say, we needed a better system. So here is what we do now. And again, this was over a four-year period, and we continue to iterate and improve. 

---
# Actually being reproducible 

TOO much GitHub (esp with IT.)
Instead, show a few examples of ways that we use to use R for comm. 
NO BULLETS.
that we can generate for each country. 
Maybe just the word "simple RMd websites"

Work on no "and" transistions with bullets.
We had a boss even thought they weren't using R, gave us space. 
Maybe numbers are less tedius "next", "second"

Slide where I say "Box 1 and Box 2". if you don't expect people to read it, dont put it here. There's a of info here b ut whe I want you to know
Box 1 is relataed to ds skills and workflow and Box 2 is the culture and comm
OTHERWISE DON"T PUT THEM IN THERE.
if you want people to realize NSSD> it then you have to point it out
Some of our resources are the NSSD podcasts and nontraditional resources for building our skills and community. 

Maybe just include part of [Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160/tables/1)? 

(maybe bullet this, and animate?)

.pull-left[
GitHub norms

- create a GitHub organization, admin privileges
  - everyone makes an account, including non-coding team members
- private "issues" repo for discussing methods
  - institutional memory, onboarding & offboarding
- use RStudio & GitHub (version control)
]

.pull-right[R norms

- all data prep, models, viz in R
- coding norms: `tidyverse` & friends
- separate core functions into R package `ohicore`
- separate local "tailorable" models into separate repos 
- data prep narratives in R Markdown
]

???
So now we have a team workflow that I think of is a simplified GitHub workflow. We have a GH org and everyone has an account, and everyone has admin privileges.

# original porrige ramble


All of this has had me thinking about how software enables teamwork and teamwork enables software. I'm going to try talking about this here; I have trouble articulating it but think it is really critical for moving forward. 

So thinking about it from the software side, there is software that is designed to streamline teamwork. So for example, Google Docs lets you co-edit and therefore co-think together in real time. GitHub helps you collaborate with others. And there are also things like the tidyverse that help create shared social norms that make it easier to work as a team. 

On the other side, if you are on a team or community you might have more courage to engage in new software; RLadies chapters, meetup groups, #tidytuesday

So for a lot of us in this room, this turns into a feedback loop and get almost difficult to differentiate and tease apart. so it might be less of a loop but more like a porridge...

And OHI is an example where one person with knowledge of the software enabled the team to engage, which meant more of us were using the software, which then strengthened the team norms and culture. 

And eco-data-science starts at the other side maybe, where it was a group of friends asking one person with knowledge of R how to learn, so it went from the team to the software and then 

But the reason I'm thinking about this is because of entry points. What if you are outside of this loop. You might use software, but not really with any collaboration or teamwork in mind. Maybe you don't even feel like you're part of a team. 

How do you engage and welcome people in those cases? 

transition: thinking about this was a big part of how I designed Openscapes. Really wanted to focus on how software can streamline teamwork and teams can learn how to use software.
